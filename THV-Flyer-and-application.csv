Since the Coordinated Entry system recently went through a major change, our funders now require that we nolonger take community referrals and instead only accept referrals through Coordinated Entry. Due to this, we willno longer be keeping our own waitlist. The only people who are now eligible are those that qualify to takeCoordinated Entry’s Crisis Assessment.
In order to be considered for a spot at the Tiny House Empowerment Village, you’ll need to either drop in or calla Housing Resource Center (options listed below), and ask if you qualify to take a Crisis Assessment (make sure tomention that you want to be referred to the Tiny House Empowerment Village shelter). If you are able to take aCrisis Assessment, and you meet the baseline eligibility requirements for our program, you’ll be placed on awaitlist that is ranked by level of need rather than order in which people apply. When we have any openings, wewill be sent referrals directly from Coordinated Entry for people ranking at the top of that list. If we receive areferral for you, we will reach out to you to ask you more questions, and to schedule an interview to see if youwould be a good fit for our program.
You can see if you qualify to take a Crisis Assessment by following one of the options listed below:

young
people
in
YSA’s
programs
in
response
to
the
crisis
of
affordable
and
accessible
housing.
There
are
more
than
1,700
homeless
young
people
sleeping
on

streets
in

on
a
given
night,
and
fewer

youth-designated
beds
in
shelters
and

people
facing

experienced
abuse
and
neglect,
mental
and
physical
health
struggles,
and
lack
of
access
to
public
resources.

Village
will
increase
the
number
of
youth-designated
beds
in

county
by
almost
40%.

Tiny
House
prototype,
unveiled
in
2017,
was
designed
and
built
by
6
youth
leaders
working
with
local
architects,
design
students,

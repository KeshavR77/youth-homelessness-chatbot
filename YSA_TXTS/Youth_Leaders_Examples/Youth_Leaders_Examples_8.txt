Name:
Jason.
Pronouns:
he/him.
Position:
Apprentice
Leader
(Studio
Assistant).
I
have
been
at
YSA
for
four
and
a
half
years.
My
current
position
is
Studio
Apprentice
Leader.
I
grew
up
in
Berkeley.
I
have
been
at
YSA
for
5
years.
YSA
is
my
family
and
allowed
me
to
have
a
community.
They
have
helped
me
a
lot
and
encouraged
me
to
be
more
responsible
in
my
role
here
at
YSA.
I
am
looking
for
a
new
job
to
plan
my
next
steps
and
YSA
is
helping
me
prepare
myself
for
new
possibilities
in
the
area
of
my
developing
interests.
My
favorite
type
of
art
is
painting.
My
favorite
art
piece
is
the
tiny
house
that
I
made.
Saving
money
is
the
biggest
challenge
for
me
now,
but
I
am
using
this
place
to
produce
new
projects
and
learn
to
support
myself.
Iâ€™m
proud
of
being
independent.
The
time
I
use
to
make
art
also
allows
me
to
think,
and
understand
my
world
around
me.
I
would
like
to
find
a
job
in
the
future
in
the
area
of
my
developing
interests.

Name:
Sean.
Pronouns:
he/him.
Position:
Youth
Leader
(Community
Organizer).
Zodiac
Sign:
Cancer.
I’m
a
Sales
Leader
at
YSA.
I
joined
YSA
in
the
summer
of
2016.
For
the
past
two
years
I
have
learned
about
the
struggles
homelessness
creates,
and
have
been
working
diligently
to
confront
the
root
of
the
problem:
lack
of
affordable
housing.
I’ve
empathized
with
many
of
the
people
I’ve
met
during
my
time
here.
The
biggest
challenge
in
my
life
has
been
hopping
back
on
the
horse
after
couch
hopping,
and
patiently
re-acclimating
myself
to
a
calm
and
relaxing
life
that
I
enjoy,
as
I
choose.
Working
as
a
team
every
day
in
a
positive
space
makes
my
day
happier
and
helps
me
feel
connected
to
something
real.
YSA
is
a
space
that
melds
worlds
together
through
community,
revolution
and
strength.
Honesty
has
helped
me
grow
as
a
person
and
in
my
leadership
position.
It
has
helped
me
own
up
to
my
short
comings
while
also
reporting
my
successes.
I
try
my
best
to
be
a
good
friend
that
ensures
my
peers
feel
their
best
when
they’re
around
me.
I’m
supportive
of
their
strengths
so
that
they
can
shine,
and
push
them
forward
to
help
them
grow
from
their
weaknesses.
It
was
an
honor
giving
an
acceptance
speech
on
the
organization’s
behalf
for
a
diploma
that
declared
April
25th
officially
“YSA
Day”
in
the
City
of
Berkeley.
My
favorite
art
piece
is
my
painting
“You’re
Your
Universe”.
It’s
the
only
canvas
I
painted
before
I
was
promoted
to
Community
Outreach
&
Organizing
Leader.
I’m
looking
forward
to
giving
back
to
my
community.
I
want
to
go
to
college
to
obtain
a
PhD
in
Law
to
become
a
Defense
Attorney,
in
order
to
prevent
Black
and
Latino
citizens
from
being
the
majority
in
the
prison
industrial
complex.

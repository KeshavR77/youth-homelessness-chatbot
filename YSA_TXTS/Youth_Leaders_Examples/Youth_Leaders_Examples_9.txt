Name:
Justin.
Pronouns:
he/him.
I
am
currently
a
Community
Organizing
/
Tiny
House
Village
Leader
at
YSA
My
family
and
I
grew
up
in
Berkeley.
My
family
has
always
moved
around
a
lot
due
to
the
increasing
amount
for
rent
and
the
shortage
of
places
to
live
in
the
bay.
YSA
has
been
a
welcoming
and
loving
space
that
has
allowed
me
the
opportunity
to
thrive.
A
personal
goal
I
have
is
just
the
usual:
finishing
up
with
school
and
maintaining
an
independent
life.
I
currently
stay
with
my
friend’s
family,
so
I’m
working
towards
financial
stability
so
I
can
eventually
move
out
into
my
own
space.

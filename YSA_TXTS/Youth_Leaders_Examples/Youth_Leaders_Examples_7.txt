I
am
a
Sales
and
Street
Spirit
Leader
at
YSA.
I
was
raised
in
Berkeley
with
my
mother
and
my
two
younger
brothers.
I
have
been
working
at
YSA
on
and
off,
for
about
four
years.
Most
of
the
time
I
was
an
aspirant
and
now
I’m
a
Sales
and
Gallery
leader.
Working
at
YSA
has
helped
me
learn
new
skills,
make
new
friends
and
help
with
my
finances.
One
of
my
life
goals
is
to
become
a
great
musician,
having
my
own
concerts
and
teaching
music
lessons.
My
second
biggest
life
goal
is
to
help
make
my
mom’s
charity
grow
and
flourish
in
all
corners
of
the
world.

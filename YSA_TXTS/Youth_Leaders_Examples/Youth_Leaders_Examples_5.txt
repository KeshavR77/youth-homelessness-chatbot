I
am

MeanCommunications
Leader
at
YSA.
I
grew
up
in
Oakland,
Berkeley,
and
Richmond.
I
currently
live
in
Berkeley.
I’m
working
towards
earning
an
Associates
Degree
in
Animation
and

Design
from
Berkeley
City
College,
gaining
more
social
media
management/
coordination
experience
and
establishing
a
more
notorious
video
game
career
as
a
streamer
and
competitive
gamer.
Since
I’ve
been
at
YSA
in
August
of
2015,
I’ve
worked
as
an
Aspirant

There
are
multiple
skills
and
knowledge
I’ve
learned
here
such
as
getting
more
comfortable
with
public
speaking,
how
to
be
a
social
media
coordinator,
getting
familiar
with
different
genders
and
sexualities,
as
well
as
seeing
the
positive
influence
that
YSA
has
upon
the
Berkeley
and
the
Bay
Area
community.
I’ve
never
been
an
artist
necessarily,
but
art
has
helped
my
life
by
showing
me
to
appreciate
the
creativity
and
originality
of
people’s
artwork,
to
have
a
more
in-depth
conversation
with
people,
and
has
presented
me
with
opportunities
to
make
money.

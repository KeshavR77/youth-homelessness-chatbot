Hi
my
name
is
Aceeyah,
I
am
a
self
taught
artist
and
most
of
my
inspiration
comes
from
my
culture.
I
am
a
traditional
and
digital
visual
artist!
I
joined
YSA
in
July
2020,
my
mom
told
me
about
it.
I
was
excited
to
join
an
organization
that’s
dedicated
towards
improving
the
community
and
encouraging
creativity.
I’ve
experienced
improving
my
management
skills,
my
collaborative
skills,
and
learning
how
to
be
professional
in
a
workspace.
My
friends
inspire
my
artwork,
because
the
emotions
I
feel
around
them
I’ll
take
it
as
a
point
of
inspiration
and
communicate
it
in
color
that
goes
into
my
pieces.
Also
my
mixed
cultural
background
inspires
the
symbolic
images
I
use
in
my
artwork,
such
as
patterns,
people,
and
clothes
shown.
I
gravitate
using
watercolor
and
using
Procreate
to
create
digital
art.
I
create
to
express
my
opinions
on
modern
problems
taking
place,
creativity,
and
telling
personal
stories.
When
I
make
art
for
myself
my
voice
is
strong,
but
when
I
create
for
others
my
voice
is
restrained.
I
experience
most
joy
when
I
create
in
the
moment
when
I’m
feeling
an
intense
emotion
that
helps
guide
my
artwork
which
can
be
in
the
form
of
an
art
piece
or
art
journal.

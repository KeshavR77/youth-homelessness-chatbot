I
was
originally
just
helping
my
friend
out
with
the
community
murals
that
YSA
was
involved
over
the
summer
and
then
recently
officially
joined
YSA
in
January
2021.
So
far
I’ve
learned
a
lot
about
people’s
lived
experiences
and
how
I’m
connected
to
that
in
some
way,
excited
to
be
collaborating
on
more
mural
projects,
and
meeting
new
people
that
are
like
minded
in
creating
and
utilizing
art
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
community.
My
creative
process
goes
external
then
internal.
I
need
a
few
weeks
to
hangout
to
then
do
my
art
extensively
for
2
weeks
then
go
out
and
socialize
again.
Harness
the
energy
from
drawing
to
then
go
channel
my
energy
to
hangout
with
friends
then
go
back
to
drawing.
The
people
that
inspire
me
are
70s
comic
artists,
90s
graffiti
artists,
and
my
friends.
My
favorite
medium
is
to
constantly
doodling
with
pencil.

Name:
Brandon
Pronouns:
he/him.
Position:
Apprentice
Leader
(Sales
Associate).
Zodiac
Sign:
Leo.
I
am
currently
an
apprentice
at
YSA.
My
hometown
is
Oakland,
California.
The
spirit
of
entrepreneurship
inspires
me.
People
say
I
am
such
a
terrific
salesman,
I
could
sell
ANYTHING.
My
preferred
artistic
style
is
Abstract
on
Canvas.
I
create
art
out
of
love
and
joy,
and
I
care
about
my
audience.
I
joined
YSA
in
2012,
I
got
brought
through
my
ACAT
youth
teacher.
My
experience
at
YSA
has
been
enjoyable
because
of
my
involvement
in
the
community
by
helping
build
the
Tiny
House
Village,
having
a
voice
in
meetings,
and
creating
artwork
to
sell
and
share
with
the
community.
Images
come
into
my
brain
and
I
draw
or
paint
them.
I
mainly
paint
in
acrylics
because
I
like
making
them
smooth
by
adding
water
and
I
like
the
feel
of
using
a
brush.
Right
now
my
theme
is
cats,
because
of
a
previous
project
I
did
for
a
client
who
wanted
a
cat
design.
I
create
because
I
feel
good
being
an
artist
and
my
style
is
abstract.
I
love
doing
artwork
for
me
and
customers
love
my
art.
It
makes
me
feel
good
when
everybody
buys
my
art.
Iâ€™m
a
top
seller!
Art
gets
me
in
my
flow.
I
like
to
be
real
with
myself.
I
want
my
audience
to
know
me,
so
my
art
conveys
stories
about
my
life.
Art-making
provides
me
an
opportunity
to
challenge
myself
and
to
engage
in
a
process
of
growth.
Creative
independence
and
autonomy
remain
a
consistent
goal
of
mine.
I
like
to
feel
powerful,
and
when
I
create
art
I
feel
very,
very
powerful.

Thank
you
for
your
interest
in
applying
to
be
a
part
of
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
community!
Since
the
Coordinated
Entry
system
recently
went
through
a
major
change,
our
funders
now
require
that
we
no
longer
take
community
referrals
and
instead
only
accept
referrals
through
Coordinated
Entry.
Due
to
this,
we
will
no
longer
be
keeping
our
own
waitlist.
The
only
people
who
are
now
eligible
are
those
that
qualify
to
take
Coordinated
Entryâ€™s
Crisis
Assessment.
1. What is the Coordinated Entry system?
2. What is the change that was made to the Coordinated Entry system?
3. How does this change impact the eligibility of potential residents for the Tiny House Empowerment Village?
4. How can someone become eligible for the Tiny House Empowerment Village under the new system?
1. The Coordinated Entry system is a referral system that connects people who are experiencing homelessness with available resources.
2. The change that was made to the Coordinated Entry system is that community referrals are no longer accepted and referrals must now be made through Coordinated Entry.
3. This change impacts the eligibility of potential residents for the Tiny House Empowerment Village because only those who qualify to take Coordinated Entry's Crisis Assessment are now eligible.
4. To become eligible for the Tiny House Empowerment Village under the new system, someone must qualify to take Coordinated Entry's Crisis Assessment.

In
order
to
be
considered
for
a
spot
at
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village,
you’ll
need
to
either
drop
in
or
call
a
Housing
Resource
Center
(options
listed
below),
and
ask
if
you
qualify
to
take
a
Crisis
Assessment
(make
sure
to
mention
that
you
want
to
be
referred
to
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
shelter).
If
you
are
able
to
take
a
Crisis
Assessment,
and
you
meet
the
baseline
eligibility
requirements
for
our
program,
you’ll
be
placed
on
a
waitlist
that
is
ranked
by
level
of
need
rather
than
order
in
which
people
apply.
When
we
have
any
openings,
we
will
be
sent
referrals
directly
from
Coordinated
Entry
for
people
ranking
at
the
top
of
that
list.
If
we
receive
a
referral
for
you,
we
will
reach
out
to
you
to
ask
you
more
questions,
and
to
schedule
an
interview
to
see
if
you
would
be
a
good
fit
for
our
program.

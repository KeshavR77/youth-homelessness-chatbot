In
2022,
YSA
hired
Director
of
Operations
Karini
Pereira-Bowers.
Her
insights
into
addressing
trauma
through
clinically-informed,
tailored
programs
and
cultural
development
have
contributed
greatly
to
meeting
the
life
outcomes
which
are
the
intention
at
the
heart
of
the
work.
YSA
was
created
because
we
realized
that
art
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
young
people
who
have
experienced
trauma
and
face
financial
challenges.
It
gives
them
a
chance
to
express
themselves
and
learn
job
skills.
They
also
get
to
make
a
positive
impact
in
their
communities
by
working
on
art
projects
that
make
their
neighborhoods
better.

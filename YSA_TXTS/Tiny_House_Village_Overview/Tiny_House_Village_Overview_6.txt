This
text
explains
the
phases
of
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
project.
The
first
phase
was
prototype
builds.
In
March
and
April
of
2019,
the
YSA
youth
team,
led
by
former
West
Coast
Regional
Manager
of
Habitat
for
Humanity
Rolf
Bell,
partnered
with
skilled
Build
Leaders
from
the
community
to
construct
the
first
two
houses.
These
houses
served
as
vehicles
for
training
and
prototypes
for
future
builds.
The
second
phase
was
community
builds.
In
summer
and
fall
of
2019,
over
500
volunteers
from
the
interfaith
religious
community
came
together
in
Habitat
for
Humanity-style
build
days
to
complete
twelve
more
houses.
Throughout
2020,
volunteers
from
the
community
built
12
more
houses,
resulting
in
a
total
of
26
completed
Tiny
Houses.
The
third
phase
was
mural
creation.
The
Tiny
Houses
have
been
painted
with
murals
designed
and
created
by
local
community
artists
and
by
youth
artists
with
the
help
of
adult
artist
mentors.
By
opening
day,
all
26
houses
will
have
completed
murals,
resulting
in
a
mobile
mural
garden
of
tiny
houses
on
wheels.
The
fourth
phase
was
moving
people
in.
In
February
of
2021,
22
youth
and
4
Resident
Assistants
will
move
into
the
Village.
The
Village
will
also
feature
two
community
yurts
with
a
kitchen
and
meeting
space,
and
on-site
communal
bathrooms
and
showers.
The
final
stage
is
growth.
To
address
the
long-term
need
for
affordable,
permanent
housing,
YSA
has
committed
to
a
“100
Homes
for
100
Homeless
Youth”
campaign
over
the
next
ten
years
through
additional
Tiny
House
Villages
and
other
models
of
affordable
housing.

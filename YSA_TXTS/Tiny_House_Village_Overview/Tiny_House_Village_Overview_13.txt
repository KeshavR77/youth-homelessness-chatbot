During
the
summer
of
2019,
former
superintendent
of
Andover
Public
Schools
David
Jackson
met
regularly
with
YSA
youth
to
create
a
covenant
of
behavior
for
the
Village
based
on
community
accountability
and
restorative
justice.
Residents
are
accountable
both
to
the
program
and
to
each
other
for
helping
all
community
members
in
achieving
their
goals.

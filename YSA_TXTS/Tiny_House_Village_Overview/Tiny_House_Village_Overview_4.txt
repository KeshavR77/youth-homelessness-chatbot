Eight
years
ago,
the
youth
in
YSA's
program
identified
the
lack
of
stable
and
affordable
housing
in
the
Bay
Area
as
the
number-one
obstacle
they
had
in
meeting
their
goals.
They
engaged
in
a
vision
exercise
and
reported
that
stable
housing,
consistent
access
to
services,
and
the
support
of
a
peer-driven
community
could
break
the
cycle
of
homelessness.
Their
vision
led
to
the
development
of
a
plan
for
a
Tiny
House
Village,
designed
with
supporting
services
and
amenities.
We
are
proud
to
announce
that
this
vision
has
been
made
a
reality.

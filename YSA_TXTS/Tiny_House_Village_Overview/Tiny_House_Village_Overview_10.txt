HCEBâ€™s
extensive
supportive
housing
management
experience
will
benefit
both
the
Village
and
the
community.
Guiding
principles
of
the
operational
plan
include:
1)
A
safe,
clean,
well-maintained
environment,
2)
A
model
that
is
fiscally
responsible,
mitigates
risk,
and
manages
liability,
and
3)
A
plan
that
ensures
that
residents
are
given
every
chance
to
succeed.
Operational
costs
will
be
offset
by
rents
from
residents.
Our
model
is
to
use
a
sliding
scale,
based
on
an
ability
to
pay,
and
we
anticipate
the
average
monthly
rental
income
will
be
$250
per
unit.
Rents
will
be
used
to
cover
the
cost
of
utilities
and
operations.
Residents
will
be
asked
to
participate
in
helping
with
monthly
cleaning
and
property
maintenance.

YSA
tracks
progress
toward
key
goals
and
objectives
for
the
following
reasons:
to
help
youth
develop
and
solidify
the
skills
they
need
to
be
job-ready,
to
improve
health
and
wellness,
mentally
and
physically,
to
set
and
meet
educational
and
vocational
goals,
and
to
progress
toward
sustainable
independent
living.
YSA
is
well-positioned
to
measure
outcomes
of
resident
progress
through
both
the
housing
and
job
training
program,
measuring
services
and
housing
stability
throughout
their
participation.
In
addition,
all
residents
develop
written
educational
and/or
vocational
plans
upon
move-in.
Regular
case
management
meetings
and
community
accountability
help
support
each
participant,
updating
plans
and
timelines
to
track
when
goals
are
met.

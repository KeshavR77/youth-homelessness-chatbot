Being
homeless,
even
for
a
short
period,
can
start
a
cascade
of
individual
and
social
tragedies
that
can
be
difficult
to
overcome.
Our
youth
are
the
key
to
our
future,
and
we
believe
that
our
community
has
a
responsibility
to
support
them.
By
providing
underserved
homeless
and
low-income
young
people
a
stable
home,
educational
opportunities,
and
job
training,
we
can
break
the
cycle
of
homelessness.

The
project
team
has
documented
the
process
of
planning,
building,
implementing,
and
operating
the
program
and
its
impact
so
the
project
model
can
be
shared
with
other
communities
for
replication.
Our
model
of
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
for
young
adults,
with
embedded
wraparound
services,
is
one
of
the
first
in
the
country.
As
such,
our
plan
is
to
document
and
share
lessons
learned,
challenges,
successes,
policies
and
procedures,
and
building
plans.
Our
work
will
therefore
have
a
greater
impact
and
this
model
can
be
used
to
help
youth
around
the
country.
THANK
YOU
FOR
YOUR
SUPPORT!

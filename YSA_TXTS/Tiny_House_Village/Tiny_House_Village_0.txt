In
January
of
2016,
youth
at
YSA
initiated
a
community
organizing
campaign
to
build
a
Tiny
House
Village
for
homeless
youth
in
the
San
Francisco
East
Bay
Area.
As
of
2023,
weâ€™ve
built
26
beautiful,
youth-designed
houses
with
the
help
of
over
2,000
volunteers
in
Habitat-for-Humanity-style
builds.
In
early
2021,
we
opened
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village.
We
worked
in
partnership
with
non-profit
developer
Housing
Consortium
of
the
East
Bay
and
the
local
interfaith
community
to
complete
a
multi-faceted,
community-led
Village
that
is
designed
by
the
young
people
it
benefits.

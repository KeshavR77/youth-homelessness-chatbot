The
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
project
was
initiated
by
young
people
in
YSA’s
programs
in
response
to
the
crisis
of
affordable
and
accessible
housing.
There
are
more
than
1,700
homeless
young
people
sleeping
on
the
streets
in
Alameda
County
on
a
given
night,
and
fewer
than
36
youth-designated
beds
in
shelters
and
affordable
housing.
Young
people
facing
housing
instability
have
overwhelmingly
experienced
abuse
and
neglect,
mental
and
physical
health
struggles,
and
lack
of
access
to
public
resources.
Youth
Spirit
Artworks’
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village
will
increase
the
number
of
youth-designated
beds
in
the
county
by
almost
40%.
The
Tiny
House
prototype,
unveiled
in
2017,
was
designed
and
built
by
6
youth
leaders
working
with
local
architects,
design
students,
and
contractors.
Now,
in
2023,
we
need
your
help
to
continue
improving
the
Village.

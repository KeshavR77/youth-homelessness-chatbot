Our
work
to
create
housing
for
at-risk
youth
doesn’t
stop
with
the
Tiny
House
Empowerment
Village.
In
response
to
the
dire
need
for
youth
housing,
Youth
Spirit
Artworks
is
engaged
in
a
ten-year
community
organizing
campaign
to
create
“100
Homes
for
100
Homeless
Youth”
in
the
East
Bay
Area.
Over
the
next
ten
years,
the
YSA
youth’s
plan
is
to
eventually
create:
25
youth
Tiny
Houses,
25
beds
in
a
total
of
five
rented
or
purchased
“co-op”
houses,
and
50
new,
dedicated
units
of
youth
housing
as
part
of
a
larger
affordable
housing
project.

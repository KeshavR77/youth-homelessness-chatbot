child.

at

help
bring
a
sense
of
creative
possibilities
to
Youth
Spirit
participants.
I
want
to
improve
&
instill
in
youth
a
sense
that
they
can
create,
in
art,
and
in
their
lives,
whatever
they
can
imagine.
Introducing
to
youth
new
methods
and
materials

the
art
making
process
is
another
of
my
goals
at

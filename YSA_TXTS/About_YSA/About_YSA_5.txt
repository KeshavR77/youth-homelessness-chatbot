History
Youth
Spirit
Artworks
was
created
in
2007
by
Sally
Hindman,
a
dedicated
Berkeley
resident
with
a
lot
of
experience
in
helping
homeless
people.
Sally
has
a
background
in
theology
and
art,
and

co-founded

But
YSA
was
not
just
Sallyâ€™s
effort.
It
was
started
by
a
group
of
committed
individuals
called
the
Advisory
Board.
Some
important
leaders
in
the
Board
were
Maheesh
Jain,
Lauren
Snider-Brandt,
Lila
McDonald,
and
Nishan
Ardon,
who
helped
with
graphics
and
marketing.
Max
Anderson,

played
a
big
role
in
getting
funding
for
YSA
and
supporting
its
vision.
